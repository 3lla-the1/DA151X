\section{Introduction}

This chapter describes the specific problem that this thesis addresses, the context of the problem,
the goals of this thesis project, and outlines the structure of the thesis.
Give a general introduction to the area. (Remember to use appropriate references in this and all
other sections.)

The first paragraph after a heading is not indented, all of the subsequent paragraphs have their first line indented.


\subsection{Backgorund}
The concept of Digital Asset Management emerged in the late 1990s as organizations began to grapple with the 
increasing volume of digital content. In the early 2000s, DAM systems evolved from on-premises solutions to cloud-based platforms, 
offering greater scalability and accessibility \citep{mccain2021}
The integration of AI and machine learning technologies in DAM systems began in the mid-2010s, 
marking a significant advancement in automating asset tagging and improving search capabilitie
This technology leverages advanced computer vision techniques to analyze and tag images automatically, 
reducing manual effort and enhancing the accuracy of asset categorization


Present the background for the area. Set the context for your project – so that your reader can
understand both your project and this thesis. (Give detailed background information in Chapter 2 -
together with related work.)
Sometimes it is useful to insert a system diagram here so that the reader knows what are the
different elements and their relationship to each other. This also introduces the names/terms/…
that you are going to use throughout your thesis (be consistent). This figure will also help you later
delimit what you are going to do and what others have done or will do.

\subsection{Problem}
As companies scale, managing digital assets efficiently—ranging from product images and marketing 
materials to technical documentation—becomes essential for maintaining brand consistency and operational efficiency.
However, existing DAM solutions, particularly open-source systems, often lack specialized 
automation for high-end manufacturing contexts, making adoption and maintenance difficult for SMEs with 
limited IT infrastructure.
\vspace{0.3cm}

A core function of DAM is image tagging, sorting, and categorization, directly influencing asset 
retrievability and structural organization. Although AI has been integrated into some DAM solutions,
 these implementations typically rely on large pre-trained models that offer broad object classification 
 rather than domain-specific tagging and vocabulary. In premium manufacturing, where products may be visually similar yet functionally 
 distinct, this lack of tailored recognition can lead to misclassification and inefficient asset management.
\vspace{0.3cm}

Recent advancements in computer vision, particularly through algorithms like YOLO (You Only Look Once), 
offer an opportunity to overcome these limitations. However, deploying a YOLO-powered system in this domain
 requires adapting the model to the specific features and vocabulary of the manufacturing sector. Rather than
  training a YOLO model from scratch—a process that demands extensive annotated data and computational resources—a 
  more feasible approach is to fine-tune a pre-trained model using company-specific data. This raises key challenges: 
  Can fine-tuning effectively capture the subtle distinctions of assets? 


\subsection{Purpose}
% State the purpose of your thesis and the purpose of your degree project.
% Describe who benefits and how they benefit if you achieve your goals. Include anticipated
% ethical, sustainability, social issues, etc. related to your project. (Return to these in your reflections
% in Section 6.4.) /

The primary aim of this thesis is to assess the feasibility and impact of a YOLO-powered DAM system 
that has been fine-tuned on company-specific data to address the unique needs of premium manufacturing SMEs. 
The research will benchmark the performance of this fine-tuned system against a conventional open-source DAM 
platform (ResourceSpace), focusing on improvements in asset categorization accuracy
and retrieval efficiency. 
\vspace{0.3cm}

\subsubsection{Anticipated Benefits and Implications}
\vspace{0.2cm}
This study is structured around a systematic process 
encompassing data collection, model fine-tuning, and system testing. 
These phases represent essential steps that a 
company would need to undertake. 
By addressing both the positive impacts and
the possible challenges, the aim is to
to inform stakeholders about whether the
benefits of adopting this AI-based solution
justify the necessary investments and efforts
The project’s outcomes are expected to contribute to 
academic knowledge in the field of AI-powered asset management, 
fostering further innovation. 

\vspace{0.3cm}
\subsubsection{Ethical considerations}
\vspace{0.2cm}
Ethically, the project will investigate issues related to data privacy, 
 transparency, and bias, which are critical in ensuring that 
automated systems operate fairly and without unintended consequences. 
These concerns are highlighted in the literature on AI ethics, which emphasizes 
the need for clear guidelines to mitigate risks associated with autonomous decision-making.

    \label{fig:targets}  
\end{figure}

From a sustainability perspective, this research contributes to the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs), specifically SDG 9, Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure, and SDG 12, 
Responsible Consumption and Production, \citep{UN2030Agenda}. 
In relation to SDG 9, and more precisely 
target 9.5 as seen in Figure \ref{fig:targets}, the project seeks to enhance scientific 
research and upgrade the technological capabilities
 within industrial sectors. Similarly, under SDG 12 target 12.6 also shown in \ref{fig:targets}, 
 this project supports sustainable business practices by optimizing digital 
asset management. By enhancing asset categorization and retrieval, the system makes it easier 
for companies to track and store metrics. This dual focus ensures that the technological advancements 
proposed are not only efficient and innovative but also ethically sound and socially beneficial.

Further reflection will be revisited in Section 6.4.


\subsection{Goals}
% State the goal/goals of this degree project.
% The goal of this project is XXX. This has been divided into the following three sub-goals:
% 1. Subgoal \#1
% 2. Subgoal \#2
% 3. Subgoal \#3
% In addition to presenting the goal(s), you might also state what the deliverables and results of
% the project are.

% Note that in the literature study and even the alpha draft, 
% these are your expected goals, deliverables, and results – which may change over the course 
% of the project – hence you will revise this in the final report to describe what you actually 
% achieved, delivered, and produced as results.

The primary goal is evaluating the feasibility of a YOLO-powered DAM
system that has been fine-tuned using company-specific data, 
in comparison to the open-source solution RecourceSpace.
To achieve this, the project has been divided into the following three sub-goals:

\begin{enumerate} 
    
    \item \textbf{Dataset Development and Annotation:}
    Develop a robust methodology for collecting a domain-specific dataset that 
    accurately captures the visual and functional nuances of digital assets 
    in premium manufacturing. The annotation process will involve: 
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item Using bounding boxes to precisely delineate asset regions. 
        \item Assigning appropriate class labels using a standardized labeling schema 
        to ensure consistency and relevance to the manufacturing domain. 
    \end{itemize}
    
    This dataset will serve as the foundation for model fine-tuning.

    \item \textbf{Model Fine-Tuning and Optimization:}  
    Fine-tune a pre-trained YOLO model on the annotated dataset. 
    The objective is to enhance the model’s 
    accuracy in tagging, sorting, and categorizing.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Adjusting hyperparameters and leveraging transfer learning techniques.
        \item Implementing regularization and validation strategies.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Performance Benchmarking and Comparative Analysis:}  
    Benchmark the performance of the fine-tuned YOLO-based DAM system against a 
    conventional open-source DAM called ResourceSpace. Evaluation metrics will include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Asset categorization accuracy.
        \item Retrieval efficiency.
        \item Overall system usability.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

A comparative analysis will be conducted to assess whether the customized 
system offers significant improvements over traditional solutions. 
Resulting in practical recommendations 
and guidelines for manufacturing SMEs 
considering the adoption of AI-powered
DAM solutions


\subsection{Research Methodology}
The methodology is designed to address both technical 
performance and stakeholder perspectives by integrating 
quantitative and qualitative approaches.

\subsubsection{Design Science Approach}
This research is grounded in a pragmatic philosophy that 
emphasizes practical impact and utility, aligning well with 
the design science research (DSR) paradigm. DSR is particularly suited for technology-driven projects as it promotes the iterative design, development, and evaluation of artifacts to solve real-world problems

At the core of this project is a design science research (DSR) approach.
 This approach supports the iterative development and refinement of the
 YOLO-powered DAM system while simultaneously providing a framework 
 for its evaluation. By designing, implementing, and empirically testing 
 the system, the study aims to generate actionable knowledge that 
 bridges theory and practice.



Introduce your choice of methodology/methodologies and method/methods – and the reason why
you chose them. Contrast them with and explain why you did not choose other methodologies or

\subsection{\mbox{Digital Asset Management}}
Krogh (2009) presents DAM as an essential system for managing digital photography in a way that prioritizes protection, 
accessibility, and longevity. While the components of a DAM system are deeply interwoven, the guiding principles 
remain consistent: images must be preserved, findable, and future-proofed\citep{krogh2009}. 
\vspace{0.3cm}

By structuring digital archives with careful attention to metadata, file formats, and workflow efficiency, he argues photographers and organizations can ensure 
that their collections remain valuable and usable over time. The primary stages of DAM can be 
categorized into five stages as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:4steg}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{4steg.png}  % Replace with actual image file
    \caption{Illustrating the main stages of digital asset management.}
    \label{fig:4steg}  
\end{figure}

\vspace{0.3cm}
\subsubsection{Technology Alone is Not Enough}

Love and Matthews (2019) demonstrated through a series of case studies that the promise of DAM
is not unlocked simply by adopting new technology but only when companies embrace two 
fundamental principles.

First, that technology alone does not create value but must be accompanied by organizational process reengineering, and second, that the benefits of DAM are maximized only through continuous strategic governance to monitor and sustain its impact.

The first principle is a recognition that technology does not automatically create value. 
Rather, its benefits are realized only when organizations actively re-engineer their processes 
and align them with strategic governance \citep{LOVE2019102930}. 

Building on these insights, Peppard (2016) argued that technology benefits cannot be achieved 
without organizational change, and change efforts must produce tangible benefits to be sustainable. 
He emphasized the need for strategic oversight to keep DAM systems adaptable and aligned with business 
needs rather than letting them become static and ineffective\citep{LOVE2019102930}.


Building on these insights, Peppard (2016) argued that the realization of technology benefits 
is inseparable from organizational transformation, stating that "benefits are unable to be delivered 
without change, and change without benefits cannot be sustained."
He underscored the necessity of strategic oversight to ensure that DAM systems evolve alongside business needs rather than remaining static implementations





What about the benefits? A missing perspective in software engineering
There are xxx characteristics that distinguish yyy from other information and communication
technology (ICT) system, as shown in Figure 2-1. Table 2.1 summarizes these characteristics.

\subsubsection{Major background area\#1\#1}
Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of various AI techniques in image tagging. 
Zhang et al. (2019) showcased the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automatic 
image classification in DAM systems, achieving an accuracy of 92\% on a diverse dataset of digital assets

This work was further extended by Li 
and Chen (2020), who integrated attention mechanisms into CNNs, improving the model's ability to focus on 
salient features and increasing tagging accuracy to 95\%

The YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm has also been applied successfully in DAM contexts. 
Wang et al. (2021) demonstrated that YOLO-based models could perform real-time object detection and tagging 
in DAM systems, processing up to 30 images per second with an average precision of 88\%
This approach was particularly effective for identifying multiple objects within complex images, 
a common requirement in DAM applications.

Transformer-based models have recently gained traction in image tagging for DAM systems. A study by 
Rodriguez and Kim (2022) applied Vision Transformer (ViT) models to DAM image tagging, achieving 
state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of 97\% on standard benchmarks
The authors noted that transformer models excelled in capturing long-range dependencies in images, 
leading to more nuanced and context-aware tagging.


While AI-powered image tagging offers significant benefits, it also presents several challenges. Data requirements 
pose a significant hurdle, as highlighted by Brown et al. (2020), who found that AI models required at 
least 10,000 labeled images per category for optimal performance in domain-specific DAM applications

Error rates and handling domain-specific content remain ongoing challenges. A comprehensive study by 
Thompson et al. (2021) analyzed error patterns in AI-powered image tagging across various industries, 
revealing that error rates increased significantly (up to 25\%) when dealing with highly specialized or technical imagery

To address this issue, Nguyen and Patel (2022) proposed a hybrid approach combining pre-trained models with 
domain-specific fine-tuning, reducing error rates by 40\% in niche industries such as medical imaging and aerospace engineerin

Despite these challenges, the benefits of AI-powered image tagging in DAM systems are substantial. A large-scale study by Garcia et al. (2023)
 across 500 organizations found that implementing AI-powered tagging led to a 60\% reduction in manual tagging time and 
 a 35\% improvement in asset discoverability


Entangled states are an important part of quantum cryptography, but also relevant in other
domains. This concept might be relevant for neutrinos, see for example [2].

\subsubsection{Major background area\#1\#2}
Computational methods are increasingly used as a third method of carrying out scientific
investigations. For example, computational experiments were used to find the amount of wear in a
polyethylene liner of a hip prosthesis in [3].

\subsection{Major background area\#2}
The application of AI-powered image tagging in DAM systems extends beyond large corporations 
to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), particularly in premium manufacturing sectors. A case study 
by Hoffmann and Schulz (2022) examined the implementation of AI-powered DAM in a high-end carpentry 
company similar to Veermakers
The study found that AI-assisted tagging improved product catalog management 
efficiency by 45\% and reduced time-to-market for new designs by 30\%.

However, Chen et al. (2023) noted that SMEs in specialized manufacturing often 
face unique challenges in adopting AI-powered DAM systems, including limited datasets 
and highly specific visual content. 
To address these issues, the authors proposed a transfer learning approach, adapting pre-trained 
models to domain-specific tasks with minimal additional data, achieving a 75\% reduction in required 
training data while maintaining 90\% of the original accuracy.

While academic research has made significant strides in advancing AI-powered image tagging techniques, 
commercial implementations often lag behind in adopting cutting-edge methods. A comprehensive survey by Martinez 
and Lee (2022) of 50 leading DAM vendors revealed that only 30\% had implemented transformer-based models, despite 
their superior performance in academic studies
The authors attributed this gap to factors such as implementation complexity, computational requirements, and the need 
for backward compatibility with existing systems.




\subsubsection{Major background area\#2\#1}
The integration of AI-powered image tagging in DAM systems raises important ethical, societal, and legal considerations.
 Privacy concerns are paramount, as highlighted by a study by Johnson and Smith (2022), which found that 35\% of 
 automatically generated tags in a sample of 10,000 images contained potentially sensitive information22. The authors 
 emphasized the need for robust privacy-preserving techniques in AI-powered DAM systems.
 Algorithmic bias presents another significant challenge. Research by Park et al. (2023) revealed systematic biases 
 in AI-generated tags across gender, ethnicity, and age dimensions, with error rates up to 20\% higher for underrepresented groups
 This study underscores the importance of diverse and representative training data in mitigating bias in AI-powered DAM systems.
\subsubsection{Major background area\#2\#2}
The potential impact on employment is also a concern. While Garcia et al. (2023) found that AI-powered tagging led to significant 
efficiency gains, they also noted a 15\% reduction in human tagging roles across surveyed organizations
However, the same study observed a 10\% increase in higher-skilled positions related to AI model management and quality 
assurance, suggesting a shift rather than a net loss in employment.
